about = The WCS 2.0 allows to send GetCapabilities, DescribeCoverage and GetCoverage requests from OGC WCS 2.0 compliant servers.
   Unlike WMS, WCS enables access to the original data (and not just to portrayals).
   The bands of interest from a multil-bands coverage can also be selected/sub-setted and their order in the output can be chosen.
   The downloaded coverages are directly loaded as layers into QGIS.
