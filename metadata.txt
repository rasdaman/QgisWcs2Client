# This file contains metadata for your plugin. Beginning
# with version 1.8 this is the preferred way to supply information about a
# plugin. The current method of embedding metadata in __init__.py will
# be supported until version 2.0

# This file should be included when you package your plugin.

# Mandatory items:

[general]
name = WCS 2
qgisMinimumVersion = 3.0
description = A OGC WCS 2.0 Client to download spatio-temporal subsets from datacubes.
version = 0.5

category = Web
author = Christian Schiller at EOX IT Services GmbH, Vienna, Austria; Bang Pham Huu; Mikhail Rodionychev; Dimitar Misev
email = misev@rasdaman.com

about = The WCS 2.0 allows to send GetCapabilities, DescribeCoverage and GetCoverage requests from OGC WCS 2.0 compliant servers.
   Unlike WMS, WCS enables access to the original data (and not just to portrayals).
   The bands of interest from a multil-bands coverage can also be selected/sub-setted and their order in the output can be chosen.
   The downloaded coverages are directly loaded as layers into QGIS.

tags = raster, wcs, wcs 2.0, webservice, ogc, download service, subsetting, AreaOfInterest, TimeOfInterest, online-access, time-series
