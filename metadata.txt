about = The WCS 2.0 Client allows to specify an Area-Of-Interest and a Time-Of-Interest and then access / download the raster data (coverages) from OGC WCS 2.0 compliant servers.
   Unlike WMS, WCS enables access to the original data (and not just to portrayals).
   For multi-band EO-imagery the bands of interest can also be selected/sub-setted and their order in the output can be chosen.
   The downloaded coverages are directly loaded as layers into QGIS.
   Requirements: This tool requires the Python lxml package to be pre-installed, e.g. with sudo apt install python3-lxml.
